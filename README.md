# ff2mpvidious-bash
## **A fork of [ff2mpv-bash](https://github.com/Ckath/ff2mpv-bash), but proxying youtube videos through invidious, with thumbnail notifications.**
You might want ping the invidious instances (can be found at [](https://api.invidious.io/) and choose the fastest ones for your location, then replace the ones used in the array at the top of the script, e.g. ``array[0]="https://yt.artemislena.eu"``.  
This script uses ``notify-send`` for notifications.
